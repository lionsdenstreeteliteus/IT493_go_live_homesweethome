                <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">How to Calculate the Total Amount of BTU’s You Require</h4>
                <p>The size of all central air conditioners are indicated in tons. This metric is utilized to measure the total amount of heat an air conditioning system is able to remove in an hour. For example, an air conditioner that is 1 ton is able to remove a total of 12,000 BTU of heat per hour.</p>
                <p>To calculate the total number of BTU’s you need for your home, measure the length and width of each room in your home to calculate the total square footage. Once you know the square footage of your house, multiply it by 25 BTU to obtain the total number of BTU’s required to maintain a pleasant temperature in your home.</p>
